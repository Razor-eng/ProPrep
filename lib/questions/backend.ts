//         answer: "RESTful APIs should be: 1) Stateless - each request contains all necessary information, 2) Resource-based - using nouns for endpoints, 3) Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), 4) Support proper response codes, 5) Have consistent naming conventions, 6) Be versioned appropriately.",

//         answer: "Database indexes are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations by providing quick access to rows in a database table. They work similar to a book's index, storing a copy of selected columns arranged for efficient searching. Use indexes on columns frequently used in WHERE clauses and JOIN conditions, but be cautious as they increase storage space and slow down write operations.",

//         answer: "Event Sourcing is a pattern where application state changes are stored as a sequence of events. Instead of storing current state, you store the history of changes. Benefits include complete audit trail, temporal queries, and event replay. Useful in financial systems and complex domains requiring audit trails.",
